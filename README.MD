# Development Log

### July 20th, 2023

I developed a user authentication backend component using Twilio for SMS verification.

There is no Web API component built out yet, it is just running locally from my `main.py` file.

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## **Application Architecture Design:**

The application follows a modular, object-oriented design that separates concerns into distinct classes, each with their own responsibilities. This design includes a `Database` class for database operations, a `UserService` class for user-related business logic, and a `UserController` class for handling HTTP requests and responses.

#### **Key Benefits:**

1. **Modularity**: Each class has a specific role, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Reusability**: The classes can be reused across the application, promoting code efficiency and consistency.

3. **Testability**: Each class can be tested independently, facilitating robust and comprehensive testing.

4. **Flexibility**: Changes in one class (e.g., database interactions) do not affect others, making the codebase more adaptable to future modifications.

This design does not inherently add security but provides a structured framework within which secure coding practices can be effectively implemented.
